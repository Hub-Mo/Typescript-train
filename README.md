# What to learn/ better understand and master
## The 4 pillars of OOP
1. [] Abstraction
1. [] Encapsulation
1. [] Inheritance
1. [] Polymorphism

## SOLID 
- [] S = Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  >“There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.”
- [] O = Open-Close Principle (OCP)
  >“Software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”
- [] L = Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  >“Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.”
- [] I = Interface Segregation Principle
  >“Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”
- [] D = Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
  >“Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.”
